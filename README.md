# RSS-Feed-Filter

In this project, I have used Python to filter out the top news stories in my(and also your) Google news feed. The inspiration for this project came from [problem set 5](https://github.com/palashsharma891/6.0001---MIT/tree/master/Problem%20Set%205) of 6.0001 offered by MIT. I completed this course about a month ago, but unfortunately wasn't able to solve this problem set. So I modified it and turned it into my own project.

The triggers for the news stories can be changed according to your preferences in lines 285-289 of the code.

If you have any doubts rearding this project, or maybe you want to collaborate, please let me know. Here is my email - palashsharma891@gmail.com
